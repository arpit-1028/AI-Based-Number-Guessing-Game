The AI-Based Number Guessing Game is an interactive console-based game where the user predicts a randomly generated number within a specified range. The game offers multiple difficulty levels — Easy, Medium, and Difficult — each with different number ranges and attempt limits.

This project demonstrates fundamental programming concepts such as:
✅ Random Number Generation using Python's random module
✅ Conditional Statements for decision-making
✅ Loops for managing user attempts
✅ User Interaction through inputs and outputs
✅ Error Handling to ensure smooth gameplay

The game is designed to be engaging, with encouraging messages, hints for better guessing, and performance-based feedback.
